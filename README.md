## About the Test

The test contains 5 questions, which are currently: 
1. You're working on a team project and a colleague takes credit for your idea in a meeting. How do you handle this situation?
2. You discover a significant error in a report that your manager already submitted to executives. What do you do?
3. A close friend asks to borrow a substantial amount of money, but you have concerns about their ability to repay. How do you respond?
4. You're offered a promotion that requires relocating to another city, but your family is settled where you are. How do you approach this decision?
5. You witness a coworker being treated unfairly by a supervisor, but speaking up could jeopardize your own position. What do you do?

These were generated by Claude, and are not particularly diverse or robust. 

Models also tend to answer by giving advice about the situation instead of pretending to be in the situation that the test presents.
